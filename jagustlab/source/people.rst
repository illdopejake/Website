    |berry| Anne Berry

    My research focuses on understanding why cognitive flexibility, the ability to dynamically respond to new task demands, declines with age. I am examining factors such as decreases in brain volume, dysregulation of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and changes in brain network activity.
 
    I completed my PhD at the University of Michigan where I worked with Drs. Cindy Lustig and Martin Sarter. Broadly, my doctoral research investigated the contribution of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the control of attention.

    |elman| Jeremy Elman

    I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in 2012 under `Arthur Shimamura <http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~shimlab/>`_. My doctoral research investigated contributions of the posterior parietal cortex to episodic memory using fMRI. As part of the Jagust lab, my research focuses on alterations in cognitive performance and multi-modal imaging biomarkers as a function of beta-amyloid deposition employing techniques that include structural MRI, task-based and resting-state fMRI, and PIB-PET.

    |saml| Samuel Lockhart

    My research project in the Jagust lab examines neuroimaging biomarkers of preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Preclinical progression along the AD pathological cascade may be inadvertently conflated with the normal aging process in many studies seeking to understand the causes of gradual cognitive decline late in life. Therefore, our goal is to investigate effects of tau and Aβ accumulation (measured using PET) on structural connectivity between these regions (measured using MRI and DTI), and the relative effects of these brain differences on memory performance.
    
    I earned my PhD from UC Davis in 2014, working with Dr. Charles DeCarli to investigate the contributions of age and CVD-related white matter injury (white matter hyperintensities or WMH) to attentional control network function and cognitive performance.

    My research in the Jagust lab examines cognitive, structural, and
    functional alterations in relation to normal aging and pathological 
    aging involving beta-amyloid deposition using multimodality imaging 
    techniques of PIB-PET, FDG-PET, structural MRI, and fMRI and 
    neuropsychological tests.

    Prior to the Jagust lab, I received my PhD from SUNY-Stony Brook in 
    2009,where I worked with Hoi-Chung Leung. My doctoral research 
    focused on the behavioral and neural bases of working memory, 
    specifically, executive processes and an interaction of visual and 
    verbal representations in healthy young adults.

    |steffi| Stefanie Schreiber

    At the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany (head: Prof. Hans-Jochen Heinze) I am working as neurologist, received my PhD in 2007 and finished my habilitation in 2014. During my habilitation I investigated the natural course of cerebral small vessel disease and its interplay with beta-amyloid-pathology in a hypertensive rat model. I came to the Jagust lab to learn biomarker PET and multimodal imaging techniques. My research in the lab will potentially focus on the interplay between biomarkers of neurodegeneration and of cerebral small vessel disease in the non-demented elderly.
