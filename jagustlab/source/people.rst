    |berry| Anne Berry

    My research focuses on understanding why cognitive flexibility, the ability to dynamically respond to new task demands, declines with age. I am examining factors such as decreases in brain volume, dysregulation of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and changes in brain network activity.
 
    I completed my PhD at the University of Michigan where I worked with Drs. Cindy Lustig and Martin Sarter. Broadly, my doctoral research investigated the contribution of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the control of attention.

    I completed my PhD in neuroscience at the University of Minnesota in the lab of Eric Newman, where I studied blood flow regulation in the rat retinal vascular network. My research in the Jagust lab focuses on understanding how aging-related changes in memory and cognition are associated with brain amyloid deposition, as measured with PET.

    `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lbKAf4cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao>`_

    My research project in the Jagust lab examines neuroimaging biomarkers of preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Preclinical progression along the AD pathological cascade may be inadvertently conflated with the normal aging process in many studies seeking to understand the causes of gradual cognitive decline late in life. Therefore, our goal is to investigate effects of tau and Aβ accumulation (measured using PET) on structural connectivity between these regions (measured using MRI and DTI), and the relative effects of these brain differences on memory performance.
    
    I earned my PhD from UC Davis in 2014, working with Dr. Charles DeCarli to investigate the contributions of age and CVD-related white matter injury (white matter hyperintensities or WMH) to attentional control network function and cognitive performance.

    |hwamee| Hwamee Oh

    hwameeoh at berkeley dot edu

    My research in the Jagust lab examines cognitive, structural, and
    functional alterations in relation to normal aging and pathological 
    aging involving beta-amyloid deposition using multimodality imaging 
    techniques of PIB-PET, FDG-PET, structural MRI, and fMRI and 
    neuropsychological tests.

    Prior to the Jagust lab, I received my PhD from SUNY-Stony Brook in 
    2009,where I worked with Hoi-Chung Leung. My doctoral research 
    focused on the behavioral and neural bases of working memory, 
    specifically, executive processes and an interaction of visual and 
    verbal representations in healthy young adults.

    |steffi| Stefanie Schreiber

    At the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany (head: Prof. Hans-Jochen Heinze) I am working as neurologist, received my PhD in 2007 and finished my habilitation in 2014. During my habilitation I investigated the natural course of cerebral small vessel disease and its interplay with beta-amyloid-pathology in a hypertensive rat model. I came to the Jagust lab to learn biomarker PET and multimodal imaging techniques. My research in the lab will potentially focus on the interplay between biomarkers of neurodegeneration and of cerebral small vessel disease in the non-demented elderly.

    Sylvia completed a Ph.D. in Neuropsychology at University of Montreal in 
    2011, with Dr. Sylvie Belleville. Her doctoral work focused on the 
    impact of vascular diseases on the cognitive profile of persons with 
    mild cognitive impairment. 

    Her main goal in the Jagust lab was to learn 
    PIB-PET and FDG-PET imaging techniques. Her research examined the 
    interaction between beta-amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, 
    vascular diseases and genetic factors, and their impact on 
    neuropsychological measures and cognitive status.
