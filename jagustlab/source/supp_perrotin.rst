**Behavioral data Subjective cognition measures**

Off-line memory monitoring. 

Participants were requested to assess their memory abilities (1) relative to other people of the same age by responding to the following question: “Compared to other people your age, how do you feel about your memory?”, and (2) relative to 20 years ago by responding to the following question: “Compared to your memory abilities 20 years ago, how do you feel about your memory?”.
On-line cognitive monitoring. Immediately after the completion of each of the 7 cognitive tasks (i.e. CVLT delayed recall, Visual Reproduction delayed recall, Stroop test, Digit and Listening Span tests, Letter and Category Fluency tests), the participant was asked to give their global postdictions of performance by responding to the following instruction: “How well do you feel you did on this test compared to other people (men/women) your same age and with a similar level of education?” (note that no feedback from the experimenter was given to the participant about task performance). Then, the participant rated her/his own performance relative to normative data on a percentile response scale (ranging from 1 to 100; i.e. from “worse” to “better than other people”). To facilitate understanding, the scale was illustrated by a Gaussian distribution of figures of people. Furthermore, specific instructions were provided on the scale and by the experimenter about the way to use the scale (e.g., for a rating of “25”, the following clarification was given: “If there were 100 healthy people your same age who took the test, you think you did about as well as or better than 25% of them, and about 75% would do better than you.”) The postdiction was recorded as a rough percentile equivalent for each of the 7 cognitive tasks. A single postdiction composite score was computed for each subject by averaging their 7 postdiction scores because of the strong inter- relational pattern observed between the 7 postdiction scores. A principal-components factor analysis showed that the 7 variables saturate on one factor both when performed within the whole BACS sample (N=185; eigenvalue=3.407, R-square=.49) and within the BACS sub-sample studied here (N=48; eigenvalue=3.716, R-square =.53).

**Brain imaging**

 *PET imaging*

Image acquisition. During scans, subjects rested quietly, eyes open and ears unoccluded, lay supine in a dimly lit room with minimum ambient noise. [11C]-PiB was injected as a bolus into an antecubital vein. PiB PET scans were obtained during a 90- min dynamic acquisition with a frame sequence consisting of 4 x 15 seconds, 8 x 30 seconds, 9 x 60 seconds, 2 x 180 seconds, 8 x 300 seconds, and 3 x 600 seconds (a total of 34 frames). Ten minute transmission scans for attenuation correction were obtained either immediately prior to or following each PiB PET scan. PiB PET data were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with weighted attenuation. Images were smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel with scatter correction. All images were evaluated prior to analysis for subject motion and adequacy of statistical counts.

Image processing. Image realignment. PiB frames 6-34 were aligned to the 17th frame, and a mean image was generated from the realigned frames. Because of the small number of counts in frames 1-5, these frames were summed together, and coregistered to the mean of the realigned frames. The resulting transform from this coregistration was then individually applied to each of the first 5 frames. Image coregistration. Each individual's structural MRI scan was coregistered to the mean PiB image obtained from the first 20 minutes of acquisition. Image analysis. PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) images were generated using Logan graphical analysis with frames corresponding to 35–90 min post-injection1,2, with the cerebellum ROI time-activity curve used as a reference tissue input function (the cerebellum was chosen as a reference region because it is relatively free of fibrillar plaques in AD3) (see below for the ROI labeling). Partial volume effects correction. In order to minimize signal washout in voxels adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid, PiB DVR images underwent partial volume correction (PVC). Using Meltzer's method4, the PVC procedure convolves a grey/white matter brain mask with a scanner-specific point-spread function, and the resulting 3D image was used to correct radiotracer counts in the native space PET image by elevating voxels contaminated by cerebrospinal fluid.

ROI analysis The cerebellum ROI (grey matter only) was used as a reference region to create PiB DVR images. A global PiB index was computed by averaging the mean PVC DVR values from frontal ROIs (caudal middle frontal, lateral orbito-frontal, medial orbito-frontal, pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, rostral middle frontal, superior frontal, frontal pole), cingulate gyrus ROIs (rostral anterior cingulate, caudal anterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate,

posterior cingulate), parietal ROIs (inferior parietal, precuneus, superior parietal, supramarginal), and lateral temporal ROIs (middle temporal, superior temporal). Regional PiB indices were defined according to choices of five a priori ROIs. Each a priori ROI was derived by averaging the mean PiB values of individual ROIs selected. The key ROIs are the following: medial PFC/ACC (medial orbito-frontal, frontal pole, rostral anterior cingulate, caudal anterior cingulate), lateral PFC (rostral middle frontal, caudal middle frontal, pars opercularis, pars triangularis, pars orbitalis), precuneus/PCC/ICC (precuneus, posterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate), medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, parahippocampal, entorhinal, fusiform) and lateral temporal lobe (middle temporal, superior temporal). The left (L) versus right (R) hemispheres were separately analyzed for each ROI.

Correlations between subjective and objective cognition The correlation between metacognitive judgments and objective scores in both the PiB groups were carried out using Spearman’s rank correlations. Results are presented in the eFigure 1. To ensure an appropriate comparison of the objective test performance to subjective ratings that subjects made relative to other people of the same age and education, objective scores were ranked on the basis of the larger BACS data (N=185) which relevant cognitive measures were adjusted for age and education (age/education-adjusted score= raw score – (b1 (age – mean age of the whole BACS sample) – (b2 (education – mean education of the whole BACS sample))), with b reflecting the regression coefficient when the raw score is regressed against age (b1) and education (b2) from the whole BACS sample). For off-line monitoring measures, general memory self-reports were compared to an age/education-adjusted memory composite score developed to encompass mixed memory measures (i.e. average of the following z-scores computed from the larger BACS sample: short-delay free recall, short-delay cued recall, long-delay free recall, long-delay cued recall and recognition from the CVLT-II, and delayed recall and recognition from the Visual Reproduction test. This composite score was reversed to fit with self-reports). Positive correlations were not significant for general memory self-reports relative to other people (whole PiB sample: r=.17, p=.245; high PiB: r=.31, p=.376; low PiB: r=.15, p=.440) and relative to 20 years ago (whole PiB sample: r=.09, p=.537; high PiB: r=.56, p=.093; low PiB: r=.03, p=.865). For on-line monitoring, each postdiction of performance was compared to objective performance obtain at the related cognitive task (note that postdictions for the CVLT-II and the Visual Reproduction test were compared to the delayed memory performance which included more than one measure; thus, to sum these delayed measures for each memory task, a CVLT-II delayed composite score was calculated by averaging the z-scores for the CVLT-II long- delay free recall, long-delay cued recall and recognition, and a Visual Reproduction delayed composite score was calculated by averaging the z-scores for the Visual Reproduction delayed recall and recognition). To allow comparisons between postdictions and objective performance, age/education-adjusted scores from each cognitive task were rescaled into percentages to match with the 100-point postdiction scale. The score range from the larger BACS sample was taken as normative data to carry out this rescaling, after having verified that performance at each task fit the normal distribution. Positive significant correlations were found on the whole PiB sample (N=48) for the CVLT delayed recall (whole PiB sample: r=.50, p<.001; high PiB: r=.37, p=.288; low PiB: r=.43, p=.023), the Visual Reproduction delayed recall (whole PiB sample: r=.42, p=.003; high PiB: r=.20, p=.544; low PiB: r=.45, p=.018), the Stroop test (whole PiB sample: r=.34, p=.018; high PiB: r=.64, p=.034; low PiB: r=.36, p=.059), the Digit Span test (whole PiB sample: r=.59, p<.001; high PiB: r=.63, p=.036; low PiB: r=.58, p=.001), the Listening Span test (whole PiB sample: r=.31, p=.033; high PiB: r=-.02, p=.957; low PiB: r=.22, p=.277), the Letter Fluency test (whole PiB sample: r=.34, p=.018; high PiB: r=.59, p=.053; low PiB: r=.13, p=.524), except for the Category Fluency test (whole PiB sample: r=.14, p=.344; high PiB: r=.32, p=.331; low PiB: r=.09, p=.647). The positive relationships between subjective and objective measures indicate that subjects in both the high and low PiB groups tended to assess their cognition in the right direction. Moreover, no significant differences in the strength of these relationships were noted between the two PiB groups regardless of the measure (i.e. high PiB subjects are not more or less accurate than low PiB ones in the assessment of their cognition). Partial correlation analyses confirmed that PiB status and objective performance have an independent relationship with subjective cognition since controlling for PiB index did not significantly modify the relationships between subjective and objective cognition measures.
