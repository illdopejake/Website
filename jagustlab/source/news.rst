THE JETLAG LAB

Our goal: to combine ideas and knowledge to mutually benefit from one another and advance our field!

Our main nemesis: a 9 hour time difference.

Stay tuned for the fruits of our collaboration!

(Feb 2013)

Jeremy Elman and his wife welcome their son Henry. It turns out the extra time he took in coming was put to good use as he weighed in at 8 lbs. 1 oz. - or about a pound and some spare change more than any of the doctors were expecting. Erin was an absolute champ and Henry is healthy, happy and - if I do say so myself - incredibly cute.
