Breaking news for the amyloid imaging community: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has agreed to a 100 million dollar, 4 year, 200 center study of 18,000 individuals assessing the utility of amyloid imaging in a clinical setting. This will be the ultimate assessment of whether amyloid PET scans should be covered by Medicare.  And the study is being spearheaded by our very own Gil Rabinovici!

Our goal: to combine ideas and knowledge to mutually benefit from one another and advance our field!

Our main nemesis: a 9 hour time difference.

Stay tuned for the fruits of our collaboration!

Jeremy Elman and his wife welcome their son Henry. It turns out the extra time he took in coming was put to good use as he weighed in at 8 lbs. 1 oz. - or about a pound and some spare change more than any of the doctors were expecting. Erin was an absolute champ and Henry is healthy, happy and - if I do say so myself - incredibly cute.
