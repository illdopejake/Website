    |elman| Jeremy Elman

    I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in 2012 under `Arthur Shimamura <http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~shimlab/>`_. My doctoral research investigated contributions of the posterior parietal cortex to episodic memory using fMRI. As part of the Jagust lab, my research focuses on alterations in cognitive performance and multi-modal imaging biomarkers as a function of beta-amyloid deposition employing techniques that include structural MRI, task-based and resting-state fMRI, and PIB-PET.

    My research in the Jagust lab examines cognitive, structural, and
    functional alterations in relation to normal aging and pathological 
    aging involving beta-amyloid deposition using multimodality imaging 
    techniques of PIB-PET, FDG-PET, structural MRI, and fMRI and 
    neuropsychological tests.

    Prior to the Jagust lab, I received my PhD from SUNY-Stony Brook in 
    2009,where I worked with Hoi-Chung Leung. My doctoral research 
    focused on the behavioral and neural bases of working memory, 
    specifically, executive processes and an interaction of visual and 
    verbal representations in healthy young adults.

    |steffi| Stephanie Schreiber

    At the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany (head: Prof. Hans-Jochen Heinze) I am working as neurologist, received my PhD in 2007 and finished my habilitation in 2014. During my habilitation I investigated the natural course of cerebral small vessel disease and its interplay with beta-amyloid-pathology in a hypertensive rat model. I came to the Jagust lab to learn biomarker PET and multimodal imaging techniques. My research in the lab will potentially focus on the interplay between biomarkers of neurodegeneration and of cerebral small vessel disease in the non-demented elderly.

    I completed a Ph.D. in Neuropsychology at University of Montreal in 
    2011, with Dr. Sylvie Belleville. My doctoral work focused on the 
    impact of vascular diseases on the cognitive profile of persons with 
    mild cognitive impairment. 

    My main goal in the Jagust lab is to learn 
    PIB-PET and FDG-PET imaging techniques. My research will examine the 
    interaction between beta-amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, 
    vascular diseases and genetic factors, and their impact on 
    neuropsychological measures and cognitive status.

    I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Jagust Lab (PI: Prof. William Jagust), 
    Helen Wills Neuroscience Center, University of California, Berkeley.  
    
    A central focus of my research work is to understand normal aging, detect 
    pathological aging and identify life-style as well as genetic factors that 
    contribute to differential aging of neural and cognitive functions. 
    
    I have trained in multimodal neuroimaging, including structural and functional 
    task- and resting-state MRI, EEG, PET and non-invasive stimulation techniques, 
    such as tDCS and TMS. At the Jagustlab, I am using biomarkers of PIB and
    FDG PET together with structural MRI to study the stage of preclinical 
    Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal older individuals.
