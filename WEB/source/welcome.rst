Welcome

The Jagust Lab is a joint research program involving the 
`UC Berkeley  Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute,
<http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/>`_
`UC Berkeley  School of Public Health <http://sph.berkeley.edu/>`_
and the 
`Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) <http://www.lbl.gov/>`_ 
.

At LBNL, neuroscientists,
radiochemists, physicists, engineers and computer scientists work
together to develop and refine imaging techniques. The imaging
facility at LBNL includes a PET, SPECT and 1.5T MRI.  We also have
another `website at LBNL <http://www.lbl.gov/lsd/>`_.

The Jagust lab is engaged in the study of brain aging and dementia. We
use the techniques of positron emission tomography (PET), structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience to
understand the anatomic, biochemical and neurochemical bases of
changes in behavior with age and dementia.
