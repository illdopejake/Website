Hit print.      * If you haven't already, put an envelope in the MP Tray         * Open the front of the printer and pull out the MP Tray         * Open up the back of the printer.  There are two turquoise-colored buttons on either side of the drawer you pulled out.  Ensure the button on the right is pushed in and the button on the left is not.  (Use the diagrams on the back of the printer for reference if this doesn't make sense)         * Adjust the sides so the envelope fits snugly into them.  Put the envelope in the MP Tray face up so the side with the stamp goes in first and the place the stamp would be is on the right.  **Beware**  This is the OPPOSITE of what the diagram ON the printer says.         * The envelope should print once you place it in the tray.  You can que multiple envelopes and print them all at once.Troubleshooting=============*************************************************************I can't print multiple copies of my single-page document************************************************************** In the print menu, deselect the box that says "Collate"******************************************************The printer wants me to "Check Waste Toner Box"******************************************************* This happens because the waste toner box fills up before the toner is actually finished.  Even more annoying--it can happen before the Waste Toner Box is actually full.  It operates on a sensor, and if the neck of the bottle gets too opaque, the printer will assume the box is full.  Luckily there's a cost-effective and only mildly dangerous solution to these problems!     * Open the little door on the left side of the printer (if you're facing the front)   * Remove the Waste Toner Box by pinching the lever to the left of the box's neck, and pull out.   * Close the box.  Use a rag to clean the area around the box, and the outside of the box itself.   * Grab a ziplock back and go outside or into the bathroom.  Dump the contents of the waste toner box into the bag.  Then put that bag into another bag and set it somewhere near the printer.  **WARNING** DO NOT INHALE OR INGEST THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX.  IF YOU GET IT ON YOUR BODY, ESPECIALLY YOUR HANDS, WASH THEM ASAP.   * Use a wet paper towel to thoroughly wash the inside of the neck of the box.  Wash it till its transparent.  Also, wash the outside of the box.  Then use a paper towel to dry everything.   * Reinstall the Waste Toner Box (see the instructions at the top of this page).
